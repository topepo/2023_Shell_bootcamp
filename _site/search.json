For example, the formula interface has made it simple to specify potentially complex model structures.\n\nR has cutting edge models. Many researchers in various domains use R as their primary computing environment and their work often results in R packages.\nIt is easy to port or link to other applications. R doesn’t try to be everything to everyone. ] ]\n\n.pull-right[ However, there is a huge consistency problem. For example: * There are two primary methods for specifying what terms are in a model. Not all models have both. * 99% of model functions automatically generate dummy variables. * Many package developers don’t know much about the language and omit OOP and other core R components.\nTwo examples follow… ]"
